# Context Based Steering AI

This project is an implementation of (Kids Can Code Context Based-Steering AI)[https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/ai/context_map/]. It's basically just a copy paste of the code with the level setup and ready to run. I added a randomized variable to the speed so the cars would have to avoid each other.

# Running the Demo

Enable `Visible Collision Shapes` in the debug menu. Click F6 run in debug mode.
